Hi, this is a tcl script allows you to create new RBE2 with greater efficiency in HyperMesh. Please do the following steps:
1. Download the file.
2. Copy the intact folder path (path + filename).
3. Open tcl command line in HyperMesh.
4. Type in "source {intact folder path}"
Now you will be able to create a RBE2 by selecting the two lines which define the screw holes.
This version of script will need you to type in 'y' to start the next RBE2.
Enjoy it!
